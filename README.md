# 🚦 Road Accident Data Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident data using Excel. The goal is to extract actionable insights that can help government bodies, road safety officers, and transport departments reduce accident rates, understand major risk factors, and implement data-driven solutions.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Tool Used**: Microsoft Excel
- **Dataset**: Road Accident Records (307,973 records)
- **Key Metrics**: Total Accidents, Casualties, Severity, Timing, Vehicle Types, Road Conditions

## 📌 Dashboard Highlights

- **Accidents by Severity**: 86% are slight, but daily volume is alarming.
- **Day vs Night**: 74% occur during the day – indicating daytime behavior is the primary factor.
- **Road Condition**: 68% of accidents happen on dry roads – showing poor driving habits over environmental issues.
- **Peak Days**: Friday sees the most accidents; Sunday the least.

## 🎯 Key Insights

- Accidents are **more influenced by driver behavior** and urban congestion than bad weather.
- Traffic safety policies must shift focus to **daylight hours**, **junction control**, and **urban traffic zones**.
- Infrastructure upgrades at major junctions and **public education campaigns** are essential for long-term impact.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning and Categorization in Excel
- Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Dynamic Charting
- KPI Tracking and Visual Storytelling
- Root Cause Analysis and Data Interpretation
- Real-world problem solving using data

## 💼 Why This Project Matters

This analysis proves that most accidents are **preventable** through smarter road design, traffic control, and public awareness. The dashboard provides a strong case for **data-driven decisions** in traffic management and policy-making.
